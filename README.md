# fastfile-parser

Converts a `Fastfile` to JSON

**Note** This repo is experimental, and will move (and break things) fast. There are a [few open issues](https://github.com/fastlane/fastfile-parser/issues) that need to be resolved before this is ready to be used. In particular the current script has issues parsing nested blocks.

**Requires Ruby 2.3.3 or above**
